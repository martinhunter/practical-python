## why difficult to learn

Programs are built upon these fundaments introduced before. But you usually can't sense them.
Even though you can sense them, you still find it difficult to learn OS, python, django, elastic,etc.

Too many layers of capsulation. High level abstraction. Too many people are joining this process without
communication.

## Python LANGUAGE
### hardwares basics
> It's highly recommended to watch [crash course computer science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpIctyqH29Q&list=PLH2l6uzC4UEW0s7-KewFLBC1D0l6XRfye) first.

- cpu retrives machine code sequence from ram and executes corresponbing instructions pre-determined by cpu producer(like intel,amd) in order.
- ram stores machine code sequence. Note that in the sequence,some are treated as instructions,some are treated as pure numbers.
- storage stores data permenantly 
- IOInterface don't know cpu instructions,so it needs driver to translate. this is why when you plugin a new mouse,usb,your computer will notify it's installing new driver.


### python is a LANGUAGE

python is a LANGUAGE, it has basic elements and follows specific grammers.Only those who use these elements and follow these grammers might communicate to each
other otherwise it makes no sense to them. But there's also a role like translator that can translate one language into another.

CPU is the core where communication(do something to info,respond,transform) happens. Data flow in other hardwares, but nothing changed.
- In the basement level, hardwares communicate by `1`,`0` signals.
- In a slightly higher level, only `1`,`0` comibinitions in cpu instructions set can be understood and executed by CPU. so all data need to be translated into instructions
meaningful to cpu. 
- In a more advanced level, commands(like +,+=,//) are more human readable, each command is a package of multiple cpu instructions.When interpreter runs,commands
are translated into these cpu instructions.

EXP: pianest plays a sonata --> sequence of keys pressed --> piano responds(CPU) --> sequence of corresponding sound --> heared by pianest

EXP: a Germany fan wants to talk to a Japanese Director.They need a translator.
info(Germany)--> translator --> info(tranlated) -->Japanese Director reply(CPU) --> replyinfo(Japanese)--> translator-->replyinfo(Germany)

EXP: the first translator is written in machine code, it will be loaded in ram and translate data.
- 'python code'(in ram)--> translator(interpreter) --> CPU execute-->
- 'python code' in machine code(in ram) --> CPU execute -->
- 'python code result' in machine code(in ram) --> translater(interpreter)--> CPU execute-->
- 'python code result'(in ram) --> displayIO translator(in ram)--> CPU execute-->
- 'python code result'IO(in ram) --> 'python code result'(in displayIO)


## Context

> or `lexical scope`, or some more undestandable word `Condition`

With only one context,all variables need to be named differently,which is impossible for big programs produced by many people.So multiple context is needed.
But be careful, multiple context causes confusion or ambiguity if you don't know the context.


EXP: John killed Mary in game context, John killed Mary in reality context.What happened is quite different.

EXP: Context 1, John has a dog named Cargo.Context 2, Mary has a dog named Cargo.One day John took Cargo to Mary's house.Then John fed Cargo. 
In this context, which Cargo John fed is ambiguous.

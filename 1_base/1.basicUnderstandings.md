## Python LANGUAGE
### hardwares basics
> It's highly recommended to watch [crash course computer science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpIctyqH29Q&list=PLH2l6uzC4UEW0s7-KewFLBC1D0l6XRfye) first.

- cpu retrives machine code sequence from ram and executes corresponbing instructions pre-determined by cpu producer(like intel,amd) in order.
- ram stores machine code sequence. Note that in the sequence,some are treated as instructions,some are treated as pure numbers.
- storage stores data permenantly 
- IOInterface don't know cpu instructions,so it needs driver to translate. this is why when you plugin a new mouse,usb,your computer will notify it's installing new driver.


### build communication

Python is a LANGUAGE, it has basic elements and follows specific grammers.Only those who use these elements and follow these grammers might communicate to each
other otherwise it makes no sense to them. But there's also a role like translator that can translate one language into another.

CPU is the core where communication(do something to info,respond,transform) happens. Data flow in other hardwares, but nothing changed.
- In the basement level, hardwares communicate by `1`,`0` signals.
- In a slightly higher level, only `1`,`0` comibinitions in cpu instructions set can be understood and executed by CPU. so all data need to be translated into instructions
meaningful to cpu. 
- In a more advanced level, commands(like +,+=,//) are more human readable, each command is a package of multiple cpu instructions.When interpreter runs,commands
are translated into these cpu instructions.

EXP: pianest plays a sonata --> sequence of keys pressed --> piano responds(CPU) --> sequence of corresponding sound --> heared by pianest

EXP: a Germany fan wants to talk to a Japanese Director.They need a translator.
info(Germany)--> translator --> info(tranlated) -->Japanese Director reply(CPU) --> replyinfo(Japanese)--> translator-->replyinfo(Germany)

EXP: the first translator is written in machine code, it will be loaded in ram and translate data.
- 'python code'(in ram)--> translator(interpreter) --> CPU execute-->
- 'python code' in machine code(in ram) --> CPU execute -->
- 'python code result' in machine code(in ram) --> translater(interpreter)--> CPU execute-->
- 'python code result'(in ram) --> displayIO translator(in ram)--> CPU execute-->
- 'python code result'IO(in ram) --> 'python code result'(in displayIO)


## Context

> or `lexical scope`, or a more undestandable word `Condition`

Python is a LANGUAGE, pragmatics(context) endues its meaning.Context ensures meaning of pragma.Time(order) is base of context.

EXP: As time goes, context improves itself, it becomes more meaningful and more difficult to understand.

Each sentence gets meaning from the context before and will serve as part of context for the sentence after.
For the sentence `John climed down the mountian.`. 
Each senetence before it is its context.It becomes one context for each senetence after it.
The most related context for it is `John climed up the mountian.`

1. ...
1. John went mountain-climbing.
1. John climed up the mountian.
1. John was hungry.
2. John ate some food.
1. John climed down the mountian.
1. John went home.
1. John ate some food.
1. ...

EXP: What Mary says is triggered by what John said and vice versa. 
If John talks about another thing(build another context), the following context will be totally different

- ...
- John: Mary, I saw on a dog on your desk.
- Mary: Oh,that's my dog Piper.
- Mary: He's very very smart.
- John: Really. Can he do any tricks?
- Mary: Yeah,when I point to him with my finger and say Bang, he will fell and pretends to be dead.
- John: Wow, can I have a try?
- Mary: Sure. You may also try to pet a dog.
- John: That might be a good idea.
- John: Oh my god! He's peeing on the desk.
- Mary: What? 
- ...


In programming, with only a whole context,all variables need to be named differently,which is impossible for big programs produced
by many people. So the whole context will be split into multiple small contexts.
But be careful, multiple context causes confusion or ambiguity if you don't know the context or contexts are mixed together.


EXP: 
John killed Mary without context is ambiguous.
Context 1,John killed Mary in game.
Context 2,John killed Mary in reality.
Context 3,John killed Mary in a novel.
With specific context, what happened is more clear.

EXP: 
Context 1, John has a dog named Cargo.
Context 2, Mary has a dog named Cargo.
Context 3,One day John took Cargo to Mary's house. Then John fed Cargo. 
In this mixed context(Context 3), which Cargo John fed is ambiguous.
